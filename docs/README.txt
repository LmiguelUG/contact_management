A simple contact management module using the Zend framework 1.12.20.

Zend Framework is an object-oriented, open source web application framework for PHP 5.
Zend Framework is often referred to as a "component library" because it has many loosely coupled components that you can use more or less independently. 
But Zend Framework also provides an advanced Model-View-Controller (MVC) implementation that can be used to establish a basic structure for your Zend Framework applications.
